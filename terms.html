    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the FinCalcPro browser extension ("Extension") developed and operated by 3rd Ventures LLC ("we," "our," or "us"). By installing or using FinCalcPro, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>

Prices are subject to change, but any price change will not affect existing purchases. Your one-time purchase grants you a perpetual license to use the premium features.</p>

    <h2>4. License</h2>
    <p>Upon purchase, we grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use FinCalcPro Premium features. This license is tied to the email address used during purchase and may be activated on multiple devices and browsers for your personal or professional use. You may not share, resell, sublicense, or distribute your license to others.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>

        <li>Use the Extension for any unlawful purpose</li>

    <h2>6. Accuracy of Calculations</h2>
    <p>FinCalcPro is designed to provide accurate financial calculations consistent with industry-standard methods. However, we do not guarantee that calculations are error-free. FinCalcPro is a computational tool and should not be used as the sole basis for financial, investment, or lending decisions. Always verify important calculations independently and consult a qualified financial professional before making financial decisions.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>FinCalcPro is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
